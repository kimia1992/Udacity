1) Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage

00:00: AZ goes down happens
00:05: Alert triggers
00:20: On call staff gets up, starts computer, logs in to vpn
00:35: Issue is diagnosed as single az has gone down
00:40: Begins recovery process of the db in that AZ
01:10: AZ comes up, db restarts, primary db recovers data it has lost and traffic starts flowing to recovered AZ

2) Minimum RTO for a single region outage

00:00: AZ goes down happens
00:05: Alert triggers
00:20: On call staff gets up, starts computer, logs in to vpn
00:35: Issue is diagnosed as single region has gone down
00:40: Begins recovery process of the db in that region in AZ1
00:45: Begins recovery process of the db in that region in AZ2
01:15: AZ1 comes up, db restarts, primary db recovers data it has lost and traffic starts flowing to recovered AZ1 (5 mins longer than 1) as it needs to recvover data from another az)
01:20: AZ2 comes up, db restarts, primary db recovers data it has lost and traffic starts flowing to recovered AZ2 (5 mins longer than 1) as it needs to recvover data from another az)

Assumption: Region that went down had 2 AZs

3) Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage

If database snapshot can be taken every minute, minimum rpo = 1 min.
Example- If database fails at 7 am, it can be recovered upto the state at 6:59 am


4) Minimum RPO for a single region outage

If database snapshot can be taken every minute, minimum rpo = 1.5 min.
Example- If database fails at 7 am, it can be recovered upto the state at 6:58:45 am. Minimum time required is slightly greater that single AZ failure as it has to recover from data present in another region which is at a longer distance.
